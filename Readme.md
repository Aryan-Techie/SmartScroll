Smart Scroll hooks into your system's volume change events and monitors:

Based on your chosen mode, it intelligently switches your knob's behavior from volume adjustment to smooth vertical scrolling.

No interference with normal media keys. No accidental triggers.

## 🚀 Smart Scroll — Enhance Your Workflow & Reimagine Your Volume Knob. 🎛️






## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### 🤔 General Questions

**Q: What makes Smart Scroll different from other scrolling tools?**  
A: Smart Scroll uniquely repurposes your existing volume knob or media dial as a scroll wheel without requiring additional hardware. It intelligently switches between volume and scrolling functions based on system states like Mute, Scroll Lock, or Num Lock.

**Q: Does Smart Scroll work with all volume knobs?**  
A: Yes! Smart Scroll works with any input device that triggers volume up/down events in Windows, including built-in keyboard volume knobs, media controllers, and even software-based volume controls.

**Q: Will this affect my normal volume control functionality?**  
A: No. Smart Scroll only transforms your volume knob into a scroll wheel when your chosen mode is active (Mute is ON, Scroll Lock is ON, or Num Lock is OFF). Otherwise, your volume controls function normally.

**Q: Is Smart Scroll free to use?**  
A: Yes, Smart Scroll is completely free and open-source! If you find it valuable, consider supporting its development through the donation link.

### 🛠️ Technical Questions

**Q: Does Smart Scroll slow down my computer?**  
A: Not at all. Smart Scroll is designed to be extremely lightweight, using minimal CPU and RAM. It runs efficiently in the background without affecting system performance.

**Q: Can I use Smart Scroll on multiple monitors?**  
A: Yes! Smart Scroll works across all connected displays. It scrolls whichever window is currently active.

**Q: Does this work with specific applications like Photoshop, Excel, or browsers?**  
A: Smart Scroll works with any application that accepts standard scroll wheel input. This includes most browsers, document editors, spreadsheets, design software, and much more.

**Q: Is Smart Scroll compatible with macOS or Linux?**  
A: Currently, Smart Scroll is only available for Windows. Support for other operating systems may be considered in future updates.

### ⚙️ Configuration Questions

**Q: How do I change which mode Smart Scroll uses?**  
A: Press `WIN + Shift + F2` to open the settings GUI, or right-click the Smart Scroll icon in your system tray and select "Open".

**Q: Can I set Smart Scroll to automatically start with Windows?**  
A: Yes! This option is already enabled by default. You can toggle it in the settings menu if needed.

**Q: Can I customize the scroll speed?**  
A: This feature is planned for a future update. Currently, Smart Scroll uses your system's default scroll sensitivity.

**Q: What if I need to use the volume knob but I'm in scroll mode?**  
A: Simply toggle your chosen mode (unmute your system, turn off Scroll Lock, or turn on Num Lock) to instantly revert to normal volume control.
