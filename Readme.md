## 🛠 How Smart Scroll Works

Smart Scroll hooks into your system's volume change events and monitors:

- 🛑 Whether the system is muted
- 🔃 Whether Scroll Lock is ON
- 🔢 Whether Num Lock is OFF

Based on your chosen mode, it intelligently switches your knob's behavior from volume adjustment to smooth vertical scrolling.

No interference with normal media keys. No accidental triggers.

A purely logical, low-footprint utility built to make your hardware smarter.
