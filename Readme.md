## 🧠 What is Smart Scroll?

**Smart Scroll by Aroice** transforms your media dial or volume knob into a powerful scroll wheel. With customizable modes that trigger scroll behavior based on system states (like Mute, Scroll Lock, Num Lock), you gain seamless, ergonomic navigation right at your fingertips.

No more awkward gestures or reaching for the mouse — **scroll like a pro with the tools you already have**.

---

## ✨ Features

- Scroll using volume knob only when specific conditions are met
- Three clean, conflict-free modes:
  - 🔇 **Mute Mode** – scrolls when system is muted
  - 🔃 **Scroll Lock Mode** – scrolls when ScrollLock is ON
  - 🔢 **Num Lock Mode** – scrolls when NumLock is OFF
- GUI to select and save modes
- Lightweight, runs silently in the background
- Tray tips for feedback
- Hotkeys:
  - `Ctrl+Shift+S` – Open settings
  - `Ctrl+Shift+Q` – Quit app

---

## 🎬 Demo

> *(Add a GIF or short screen recording here — `assets/demo.gif`)*  
> You can use ShareX or OBS to record a small clip of you scrolling using the volume knob and toggling modes via GUI.

---

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Aryan-Techie/Smart-Scroll/releases).
2. Extract and run `SmartScroll.exe` *(or the `.ahk` script if you have AutoHotkey installed)*.
3. Use `Ctrl+Shift+S` to open the mode selection GUI.

## 🖥️ Who Is It For?

- 🧑‍💻 Power users, devs & automation geeks
- 📚 Researchers and writers
- 🎧 Music producers and media creators
- 🎮 Gamers and streamers
- ⚙️ Anyone who uses a volume knob or dial controller

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

Smart Scroll listens for volume knob inputs and checks:
- Is the system muted?
- Is Scroll Lock on?
- Is Num Lock off?

Based on your selection, it switches the knob from volume to scroll mode. It’s clean, simple, and doesn't interfere with regular use when the mode is inactive.
