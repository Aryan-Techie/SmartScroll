### ü§î General Questions

**Q: What makes Smart Scroll different from other scrolling tools?**  
A: Smart Scroll uniquely repurposes your existing volume knob or media dial as a scroll wheel without requiring additional hardware. It intelligently switches between volume and scrolling functions based on system states like Mute, Scroll Lock, or Num Lock.

**Q: Does Smart Scroll work with all volume knobs?**  
A: Yes! Smart Scroll works with any input device that triggers volume up/down events in Windows, including built-in keyboard volume knobs, media controllers, and even software-based volume controls.

**Q: Will this affect my normal volume control functionality?**  
A: No. Smart Scroll only transforms your volume knob into a scroll wheel when your chosen mode is active (Mute is ON, Scroll Lock is ON, or Num Lock is OFF). Otherwise, your volume controls function normally.

**Q: Is Smart Scroll free to use?**  
A: Yes, Smart Scroll is completely free and open-source! If you find it valuable, consider supporting its development through the donation link.
